# Survey System Updates

## Objective
Ensure consistent tracking of survey context through explicit ID management

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Webhook Service Modifications
- Updated `services/webhook.py` to require explicit `user_id` and `channel_id`
- Modified payload construction to prioritize direct ID parameters
- Added session ID tracking combining channel+user IDs

### 2. Survey Flow Improvements
- Updated `bot/commands/survey.py` to:
  - Pass explicit IDs in all webhook calls
  - Use combined session IDs for survey tracking
  - Add error handling for missing ID context

### 3. Session Management
- Modified `services/survey.py` SurveyFlow class to:
  - Require channel_id, user_id and session_id in constructor
  - Store session_id as composite key
  - Update survey lookup logic to use session IDs

### 4. Initialization Changes
- Updated `web/server.py` button handling to:
  - Encode session ID in button custom_id
  - Pass full context to survey initialization
  - Validate ID types before survey creation

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Survey buttons create proper session IDs (channelid_userid)
- [ ] All webhook calls include explicit IDs
- [ ] Error handling works for missing ID cases
