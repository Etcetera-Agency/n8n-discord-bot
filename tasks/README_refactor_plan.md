# README.md Refactoring Plan

This plan outlines the steps to refactor the `README.md` file for the n8n-discord-bot project, focusing on improving clarity, conciseness, and the overall flow, with a particular emphasis on features related to commands, surveys, and the detailed communication payloads between the bot and n8n.

## Goals

*   Improve the overall readability and user-friendliness of the README.
*   Highlight key features, especially commands, surveys, and bot-n8n communication.
*   Reorganize sections for a more logical flow.
*   Ensure clarity and conciseness throughout the document.
*   Correct the formatting of the project structure diagram.

## Revised Refactoring Plan Steps

1.  **Analyze Current Content:** Review the existing `README.md` to identify redundant phrases, unclear explanations, and sections that could be better organized. Pay close attention to the sections on Features, Survey Control, and Communication.
2.  **Reorganize Sections:**
    *   Keep the "Features" section prominent, potentially expanding on the key features like Session Management, Visual Feedback, Reliability, Scalability, Extensibility, and Modular Architecture.
    *   Combine "Overview" and "How It Works" into a single section like "Architecture" or "How it Works".
    *   **Introduce a dedicated "Bot-n8n Communication" section:** This section will clearly outline the different types of requests the bot sends to n8n (User Mention, Button/Select Interaction, Survey Step Submission, Survey Completion, Slash Command) and the corresponding response types from n8n (Simple Text, Buttons, Select Menus, Survey Control - Continue/Cancel/End).
    *   Keep the detailed JSON examples for payloads and responses within the "Bot-n8n Communication" section, ensuring they are well-formatted and easy to read.
    *   Integrate the "Survey Control" details (continue, cancel, end, timeouts, starting from n8n) within or closely linked to the "Bot-n8n Communication" section, emphasizing the flow and payloads.
    *   Group all setup and running instructions logically (Prerequisites, Installation, Configuration, Running Locally, Running with Docker).
    *   Group deployment options together.
    *   Ensure the "Project Structure" diagram is correctly formatted and placed appropriately.
    *   Place the "Discord Character Limit" note in a relevant section, possibly near Interaction Examples or Bot-n8n Communication.
    *   Keep the "Contributing" and "LLM Assistance" sections, potentially towards the end.
3.  **Improve Clarity and Conciseness:**
    *   Rewrite sentences and paragraphs to be more direct and easier to understand, especially in the sections focusing on features and communication.
    *   Use bullet points and formatting (bolding, code blocks) effectively to break up text and highlight key information.
    *   Ensure consistent terminology throughout the document.
    *   Remove any repetitive information.
4.  **Update Project Structure Diagram:** Correct the formatting for the project structure code block.
5.  **Implement Changes:** Apply the proposed structure and content edits to the `README.md` file.
